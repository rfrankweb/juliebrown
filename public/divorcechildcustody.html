          <h2>Contested Divorce</h2>
          When neither spouse can agree on one or more settlements during a
          divorce, they are dealing with a contested divorce. In today’s age,
          these are more common. These often have to be settled in a court of
          law, and you must have a great attorney on your side that settles
          disputes fairly and in your favor.
          <h2>Parenting Agreements</h2>
          If you have children while going through a divorce, a parenting
          agreement must be formed. This is a document that states things such
          as where the child will be going, who is responsible for the child,
          etc. This is essential for providing stability to the child and
          preventing them from wondering where they should be at a certain
          point. An attorney can help write the document and make sure that
          everything is laid out and that nothing is missing.
          <h2>Support and Support Modification</h2>
          Because it may be hard to keep up on payments as a single parent with
          one or more children, child support is an option. Child support is
          paid for by at least one of the spouses, usually the one without
          custody. These can help keep your child off of welfare and can cover
          many expenses from food to entertainment. A divorce attorney can help
          set this up for your family.
          <br />
          Child support payments are based on many factors, such as housing or
          employment. But things change. One or more of the spouses may lose
          their job or be unable to make payments. If this occurs, an attorney
          can help modify child support can be modified depending on what is
          going on in the parents’ lives.
          <h2>Property Division</h2>
          When going through a divorce, all assets and debts need to be divided
          across the spouses evenly. It can be confusing when finding out who
          gets what, and many factors are involved. These issues can
          occasionally be solved by the spouses, but during a divorce, many
          things are going through your mind, and your judgment may be clouded.
          An attorney must help divide all of your assets and debts evenly and
          fairly.
          <h2>Community Property</h2>
          Community property is a law that is recognized in eight states,
          California being one of them. Essentially, community property is
          anything bought during the marriage, such as shared income or housing.
          The second kind of property is separate property and is anything owned
          before the marriage. The community property law states that in a court
          of law, this property is split across the spouses equally, and is then
          treated as separate property. An attorney is important in making sure
          property division is fair and just.
          <h2>Pension and Retirement Benefits</h2>
          Under divorce law, any form of pension given to the family during a
          marriage is considered an asset to both spouses and can be split
          evenly. Although this is true, this is not done automatically and must
          be requested. A divorce attorney can help you through the process so
          that the court can award it to you.
          <h2>Allocation of Debts</h2>
          Many families create debt during the marriage, whether it be home
          loans or emergencies. When going through a divorce, allocating debts
          is just as important as separating assets. To make sure that the
          distribution of debts is fair to the spouses, it is important to have
          a good attorney to work things out.
          <h2>Pre and Post Nuptial Agreements</h2>
          Prenuptial and postnuptial agreements are agreements on how finances
          will be divided up after a divorce. Prenups(prenuptial agreements)
          happen before the marriage and vice versa for postnups(postnuptial
          agreements). These are helpful for attorneys to more easily figure out
          the finances of a marriage, especially with tax laws. An attorney may
          create one if there is a lot of wealth involved in the marriage, if it
          is not one of the spouse’s first marriages, or if a death occurring to
          one or more of the spouses is likely in the moderately near future.
          <h2>Settlement Agreements</h2>
          There must be a written document discussing all of the factors of
          divorce. This is known as a settlement agreement. These make sure that
          there is a record of the divorce that can be used as a reference by
          the government or the spouses. An attorney will help write one out
          that covers every detail in the divorce.
          <h2>Domestic Partnership/Same-Sex Marriage</h2>
          When two individuals live together in the same home(known as a
          domestic partnership), it is required to certify that the partnership
          has ended. Ending a domestic partnership can be as easy as filling out
          a form and paying a fee but can get more complicated depending on
          factors like location, property, and child custody. A divorce attorney
          is helpful as domestic partnership laws differ from location to
          location, and ending the partnership can be as messy as a divorce.
          <h2>Judgment Enforcement</h2>
          When a judgment about a divorce is made by a court of law, it is up to
          the spouses and other members of the parties to make sure that these
          decisions are enforced. This can often be difficult for individuals. A
          divorce attorney can help to make sure that both parties are keeping
          up to what was agreed to during a divorce.
