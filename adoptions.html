          <h2>Unplanned/Unwanted Pregnancy</h2>
          If you find yourself with an unplanned/unwanted pregnancy and you are
          unable to care for a child, adoption is an option for the child. Here
          at Brown and Associates, we can help to set your child up for adoption
          as well as help to find a forever family.
          <h2>Facilitate the Adoption Process</h2>
          To legally adopt a child, it is required that an adoption attorney
          works through the paperwork and guides you through the process of
          adoption. Adoption is a very complicated procedure, and you must have
          a great adoption attorney that helps to remove the stress of adoption.
          <h2>Home Study Counseling</h2>
          During the adoption, a home study will be performed on your home. This
          is required by the state of California, and checks to see what the
          child’s home life will be like, and helps the adoption worker
          understand who you are as a family. This also educates the family on
          adoption and evaluates the family.
          <h2>Stepparent Adoptions</h2>
          If a spouse has had a child before the marriage, the other person can
          adopt the child into the family, known as a stepparent adoption. This
          creates feelings of permanence and recognizes the individual as a
          parent. These are similar to regular adoptions, and you must have an
          adoption attorney to guide you through the process.
          <h2>Contested Adoptiions</h2>
          A contested adoption occurs when one biological parent wants to place
          the child up for adoption, while the other does not. If it is
          contested, a hearing is required in a court of law, and a judge hears
          evidence and stories from both sides and makes a decision. An adoption
          attorney is necessary to help make your case and help the judge see
          your side of the story better.
          <h2>Freedom from Custody and Control</h2>
          If a child is to be adopted and it is unknown where one or more of the
          parents are, it is required that the parental rights are terminated.
          To do this, you must have a great adoption attorney to help you and to
          complete the adoption process.
